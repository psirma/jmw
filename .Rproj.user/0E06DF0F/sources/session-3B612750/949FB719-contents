I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Public Policy at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill.

My research studies social protection programs in low- and middle-income countries. In my dissertation, I document the impacts of the government of Malawi’s largest poverty alleviation program — the Malawi Social Cash Transfer Program (SCTP) — an unconditional cash transfer currently reaching the poorest 8 percent of population, roughly 282,213 households. My job market paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the short-term (two years since baseline) and the long-term (eight years since baseline) impacts of the SCTP on school enrollment and grade attainment.

I completed my primary and secondary school education in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where I was born and raised. In 2011, I moved to the U.S. to pursue my undergraduate studies in Economics at Colgate University. Upon completing my studies, in 2015, I joined American Institutes for Research in Washington, D.C., where I worked as a Research Assistant in the International Research and Evaluation Division until 2018.
