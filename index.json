The primary objective of these programs is to reduce poverty and hunger. Short-term evaluations of UCTs in Africa have documented their effectiveness in increasing school enrollment. However, we know little about the link between UCTs and long-term educational outcomes. This paper fills this gap in the literature by presenting long-term evidence (8 years since baseline) on how a UCT program in Malawi affected school enrollment and grade attainment. The delayed rollout of this UCT meant that households in the treatment group were exposed to three more years of support compared to households in the control group. I find that the timing of the additional years of support are important among children who were not enrolled in school at baseline (out-of-school), and among older children (10-15 years old at baseline)—for whom the opportunity costs of schooling are the highest. On average, among all children in my sample, I find that out-of-school boys and girls in the treatment group accumulated about 0.2 more years of schooling than their peers in the control group. However, these differences are not statistically indistinguishable from zero. Whereas among older children, I detect impacts of about 0.4 years of schooling among out-of-school boys and girls. The results are statistically significant for older out-of-school girls. These findings speak to the promise for UCTs to transform household long-term human capital, particularly among marginalized populations who lack access to education and with a closing window of opportunity to enroll in school.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Long-term impacts of unconditional cash transfers on schooling: evidence from Malawi","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Sirma","(with Sudhanshu Handa)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1659830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1659830400,"objectID":"dba946912013a25303930cb17cc26d93","permalink":"/publication/working-paper/","publishdate":"2022-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/working-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we show that liquidity is an important constraint that prevents households from allocating their labor efficiently. We estimate the impacts of unconditional cash transfer program in Malawi, 30 months since baseline, and find large positive impacts on agricultural production and on-farm labor. We also find negative impacts on casual or ganyu labor. To explain these results, we test and reject the separation assumption of the agricultural household models. We show that demographic variables are associated with on-farm labor demand. We also show that cash transfers enable treated households to invest in agricultural inputs, which increases their on-farm productivity.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"The effect of unconditional cash transfers on labor allocation and farm productivity ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Sirma","Frank Otchere","Sudhanshu Handa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625356800,"objectID":"32f3ea00ba61a9c0e5b213af3352913c","permalink":"/publication/published-paper/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/published-paper/","section":"publication","summary":"Governments in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have rapidly expanded cash transfer programmes as part of their social protection strategy over the last decade. Currently 46 countries have a state-sponsored social protection programme, compared to just 25 countries in 2005, with the most common type of programme being cash transfers, representing 51% of all social protection spending in the region. We present evidence on the overall impacts of state-sponsored cash transfer programmes in SSA, using data from three impact evaluations of government programmes. All three programmes were a key component of the poverty reduction strategy of the respective governments at the time of the evaluations. We show impacts across nine broad domains including both protection, production and human development, using baseline and follow-up household surveys on Treatment and Control groups. We relate the pattern of impacts to programme design parameters to further understand the constraints faced by ultra-poor rural households. All three programmes have strong effects on their primary objective—food security or food consumption, as well as on secondary objectives that include livelihood strengthening and children’s well-being. The largest and most consistent impacts occur in Malawi, where transfer values are in line with international best practice and payments were made regularly during the study period. All programmes show a positive income multiplier, with the multiplier largest in Malawi at 2.94. The overall results across three national programmes add to the growing evidence from Africa that government unconditional cash transfers have important positive effects on households, that these effects are not limited to just food security, and that programme design features influence the pattern and size of impacts. Results in this article are based on programmes that pass both criteria of implementation feasibility and political acceptability, and thus provide a more accurate reflection of what real-world cash transfer programmes can achieve in SSA.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"More evidence on the impact of government social protection in sub-Saharan Africa: Ghana, Malawi, and Zimbabwe","type":"publication"}]
