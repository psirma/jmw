abstract: In this paper, we show that liquidity is an important constraint that prevents households from allocating their labor efficiently. We estimate the impacts of unconditional cash transfer program in Malawi, 30 months since baseline, and find large positive impacts on agricultural production and on-farm labor. We also find negative impacts on casual or ganyu labor. To explain these results, we test and reject the separation assumption of the agricultural household models. We show that demographic variables are associated with on-farm labor demand. We also show that cash transfers enable treated households to invest in agricultural inputs, which increases their on-farm productivity.
