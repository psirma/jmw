abstract: Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) are among the most popular social protection programs in Africa. The primary objective of these programs is to reduce poverty and hunger. Short-term evaluations of UCTs in Africa have also documented their effectiveness in increasing school enrollment. However, we still know very little about their effectiveness in the long term. This paper fills this gap in the literature by presenting long-term evidence (8 years since baseline) of a UCT in Malawi on school enrollment and grade attainment. In the long run, I find that older out-of-school girls (ages 10-15 years at baseline) in the early treatment households accumulated more years of schooling than their peers in the late treatment households.
